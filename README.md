# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset to understand the data through statistics and visualization.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## 📊 Tasks Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Displayed summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
3. Created visualizations:
   - Histograms of numerical features
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Pairplots to identify relationships
   - Correlation matrix to find linear relationships
4. Used Plotly for interactive visualizations.
5. Inferred patterns such as class-based survival trends and gender influence.

- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `Titanic_Dataset_Sample.pdf`: Sample dataset displayed in a PDF format.

## ✅ Insights
- Higher class passengers had higher survival rates.
- Women and children were more likely to survive.
- Fare and class correlated with survival probability.
